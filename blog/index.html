      <h3 class="dev">Going Public as a Web Developer<span class="badge">January 20th, 2016</span></h3>
          <p>I have completed my website that advertises my services as a Freelance Web Developer.  The purpose of the site is to show some of my skills and provide the customer with information about my services.  I am now going to spend some of my time completing and logging some of the contracts that I gain.  This will increase my Web Development experience.  My plan is to make three or so basic websites, informational websites.  Then I am going to expand into the more functionality websites.  As I move up from design to functionality, I will be studying new materials.</p>
      <h3 class="stand-up">Going Public as a Stand-up Comedian<span class="badge">January 20th, 2016</span></h3>
          <p>Today I went to the Curious Comedy Theater in Portland and preformed for an open mic night that they have every Sunday.  I only had 3 minutes of stage time, but being that this is the first open mic that I have done I was satisfied with the duration.  I think that the performance went alright.  The audio file recording that I took is below. </p>
