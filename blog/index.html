      <h3 class="dev">Registered Google Business<span class="badge">February 21st, 2016</span></h3>
          <p>I just finished registering my business to Google.  This will improve my web presence greatly.  Now I am present on Google maps under the name "Sdev Web Development and Design".</p>
      <h3 class="dev">The Seattle Window Cleaner Site<span class="badge">February 15th, 2016</span></h3>
          <p>I just complete a website for a Window cleaner in Seattle Washington.  This website helps to present some of the services that Vision Window Cleaning Plus offers.  The old site was being posted on Weebly, a free website layout editor, and I changed DNS settings to redirect the URL to a Github page that I set up for the customer.  Overall the customer seemed very happy with the design and better search result placement.  The link to the website can be found below.</p>

      <h3 class="dev">Going Public as a Web Developer<span class="badge">January 20th, 2016</span></h3>
          <p>I have completed my website that advertises my services as a Freelance Web Developer.  The purpose of the site is to show some of my skills and provide the customer with information about my services.  I am now going to spend some of my time completing and logging some of the contracts that I gain.  This will increase my Web Development experience.  My plan is to make three or so basic websites, informational websites.  Then I am going to expand into the more functionality websites.  As I move up from design to functionality, I will be studying new materials.</p>
